      <description>IntroductionIn our final group assignment, we analyse data about Airbnb listings, and we try to find a model to predict the total cost for two people staying 4 nights in an AirBnB in Shanghai. Our data set comes from insideairbnb.com; it was originally scraped from airbnb.com. Our work is structured as follows: We begin by cleaning our data set. For instance, we remove outliers, delete NAs, and convert non-numeric data into numeric data.</description>

      <description>What is GDP?Gross domestic product (GDP) is a monetary measure of the market value of all the final goods and services produced in a specific time period. GDP (nominal) per capita does not, however, reflect differences in the cost of living and the inflation rates of the countries; therefore, using a basis of GDP per capita at purchasing power parity (PPP) is arguably more useful when comparing living standards between nations, while nominal GDP is more useful comparing national economies on the international market.</description>

      <description>Yield Curve inversionEvery so often, we hear warnings from commentators on the “inverted yield curve” and its predictive power with respect to recessions.
In our case we will look at US data and use the FRED database to download historical yield curve rates, and plot the yield curves since 1999 to see when the yield curves flatten.
First, we will use the tidyquant package to download monthly rates for different durations.</description>
